# Focus: Core syntax, Lists, Dictionaries, Functions, and Control Flow.
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------

# --- 1. Variables and Basic Data Types ---
# In Python, you don't need to declare types; they are inferred automatically.

threat_score = 95           # Integer: Used for counting and scoring.
is_critical = True          # Boolean: Used for True/False logic.
source_ip = "192.168.1.10"  # String: Used for text and identifiers.

print(f"System IP: {source_ip}, Score: {threat_score}")
print("-" * 30)

# --- 2. Lists (Ordered Collection) ---
# Lists are ordered collections, perfect for sequences of events or feature sets.
log_events = ["Login Failed", "DB Access", "External Transfer", "Login Failed", "System Crash"]
print(f"Total events in log: {len(log_events)}")

# Accessing an element (indexing starts at 0)
print(f"First event: {log_events[0]}")
print(f"Last event: {log_events[-1]}")
print("-" * 30)

# --- 3. Dictionaries (Key-Value Pairs) ---
# Dictionaries are used for organized, labeled data, like mapping an IP to its status.
user_profile = {
    "user_id": "grant_k",
    "role": "Admin",
    "status": "Active",
    "last_login": "2025-09-20"
}

print(f"User Role: {user_profile['role']}")
print("-" * 30)

# --- 4. Control Flow: Conditional Logic (if/elif/else) ---
# Essential for implementing security rules and decision-making.
if threat_score > 90 and is_critical:
    print("ALERT: Immediate action required (Threat Score is Critical).")
elif threat_score > 50:
    print("WARNING: Investigate user activity.")
else:
    print("Status: Normal.")
print("-" * 30)

# --- 5. Control Flow: Iteration (for loops) ---
# Essential for processing massive amounts of log entries and data batches.
print("Processing Events:")
suspicious_count = 0
for event in log_events:
    if "Failed" in event or "Crash" in event:
        print(f"    - Found a suspicious event: {event}")
        suspicious_count += 1
print(f"Total suspicious events found: {suspicious_count}")
print("-" * 30)

# --- 6. Defining a Reusable Function ---
# Functions group logic into one reusable block, making code clean and scalable.
def check_authentication_status(username, attempts):
    """Returns a security recommendation based on login attempts."""
    if attempts > 3:
        return f"User {username}: Too many failures. ACCOUNT LOCKOUT RECOMMENDED."
    else:
        return f"User {username}: Status OK."

# Calling the function
print(check_authentication_status("test_user_1", 5))
print(check_authentication_status("authorized_user", 2))
